"""
Reads in the data from all the TFRecord files pertaining to a mixerfile.
Calculates asynchrony for that data and writes out to a matching set of files.

NOTES:
    - TFRecord terminology:
        Each TFRecord file is composed of multiple 'examples'
        (GEE equiv: 'patches'), each of which is composed of multiple
        'features' (GEE: 'bands'), each of which has both
        a 'key' (GEE: 'band name', e.g. 'sin_1') and a value
        (GEE's actual raster of image data; in TFRecord they are stored
        and reading in as 'float_lists' composed of numerous 'value: #######'
        pairs, where ##### is the actual numerical value in a cell).

        In other words, the TFRecord format looks like:

            file_n.tfrecords:

                example 1:

                    feature {
                        key: "constant"
                        value {
                            float_list {
                                value: -9999.0
                                value: -9999.0
                                value: -9999.0
                                .

                                .
                                }
                            }
                        key: "sin_1"
                        ...
                        key: "sin_2"
                        ...
                        ...
                        }

                example 2:

                    feature {
                        ...
                        }
                ...

                example last:

                    feature {
                        ...

"""
Finds all pixel-center coordinates within neigh_dist (in meters) of
the input lat,lon coordinates.

To do this, a BallTree (constructed to use the Haversine distance metric)
is first queried to find all neighbors within the neighborhood radius (in meters)
(rather than my former approach, which was based on the
minimum distance of a degree longitude at my highest latitude, i.e. 60Â° N/S)

Then a Haversine distance calculator is used to calculate the actual distance,
in meters, of each pixel's centerpoint from the focal pixel's centerpoint.
NOTE: Could use the knn function called on the BallTree instead, but quick profiling at
the REPL shows that to be ~175x slower (0.004068 sec vs 0.000023 sec, for 874 neighs,
using the @time macro)

Neighbor pixels' (lat,lon coordinates) => (distances, (array indices)) are returned
as key => value pairs in a dict.
