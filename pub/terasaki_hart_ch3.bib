abstract = {{ Soil organic carbon (SOC) dynamics along land-use changes influences the terrestrial and global carbon cycle, the climate, soil fertility, agricultural productivity, and food security. Taking soils under native forests as an appropriate ecological reference, we studied changes in soil organic carbon stock along eight land-use types in the highlands of Ethiopia. The general objective of the study was to investigate the dynamics of SOC stock following chrono-sequence land-use/cover systems in the highlands of Ethiopia. The specific objectives were to: (1) analyze loss due to land degradation; (2) analyze gain due to land restoration; and (3) estimate partial balance of SOC stock for the highlands of Ethiopia. The study followed the principle of the Forest Transition Theory (FTT). Eleven sub-areas were considered from the highlands of Ethiopia. A total of 241 auger composite samples from the topsoil (0−20 cm depth) were collected during December 2017 to June 2018, and analyzed at CropNut soil lab in Nairobi. The study results revealed that there were statistically significant variations (P < 0.05) across the land-use types with the mean stocks ranging from 31.4 Mg SOC ha−1 in soils of intensively grazed lands to 145.0 Mg SOC ha−1 in soils of guasa grasslands. Soils of natural/pristine vegetation and protected guasa grasslands contain the highest amount of SOC stock. Therefore, there should be more aggressive efforts towards an effective protection of these ecosystems. Soils under intensively used croplands and intensively grazed lands lost, respectively, 64.95\% and 78.16\%, SOC stocks originally accumulated in the top surface layers of the pristine forests. This points for the need to adopt locally feasible land management practices that lead to increased SOC stock and simultaneously reduced CO2 and greenhouse gas emissions from croplands and intensively grazed lands of the highlands of Ethiopia. Compared to stocks of SOC of intensively grazed lands (31.44 Mg SOC ha−1), the annual stock gains in soils of controlled grazing lands (4.60 Mg ha−1) were > gains in soils of enclosures (3.17 Mg ha−1) > gains in soils of afforestation (2.35 Mg SOC ha−1), which signifies that converting degraded lands to either controlled grazing lands, enclosures, or afforestation would be a promising practice for an enhanced carbon sequestration across the highlands of Ethiopia. This practice is in line with the United Nations’ Sustainable Development Goals. The estimated regional partial stock balance revealed that the loss and gain ratio was 35.1 in 1991, and it declined to 15.4 in 2001, 2.2 in 2011 and 1.8 in 2015. These decreasing ratios indicate the possibility of closing the gap between the losses and the gains in the near future, and eventually shifting to higher rates of gains than losses. It is also important to note that determined efforts towards the effective protection of natural forests and the creation of enclosures and reforestation areas by local communities for enhanced carbon sequestration will benefit them from payments of carbon emission reduction (CER) credits.}},

NIRV-derived estimates of GPP are systematically higher than existing bottom-up estimates, especially throughout the midlatitudes.

Rainforest species organize within this vertical spatial gradient and recent macroecological research suggests that the highest levels of vertical stratification occur in structurally complex and climatically stable tropical rainforests. However, although the classical view of the tropics is that of aseasonality, particularly in temperature, there is strong seasonality in rainfall. Thus, we predict considerable variation in vertical stratification in time, characterized by a seasonal restructuring of communities across vertical space. Sierra Llorona, Colón Province, Panama. Amphibians. We performed 121 ground‐to‐canopy surveys across the wet and dry seasons for amphibians. Using a bootstrap simulation method we calculated species‐specific and community‐wide vertical height and abundance shifts between seasons. Separately, we tested the importance of vertical height and season on the vertical distribution of species using a redundancy analysis, and employed linear models to explore turnover in species composition across vertical height between seasons. Our results show a clear downward shift of 5 m in height in amphibian communities from the wet season to dry season. We also observe significant changes in species composition across vertical strata in both seasons, driven primarily by nestedness in the dry season (loss of species over height) and genuine turnover in the wet season (loss and addition of species over height). The exploitation of canopy microhabitats and resources in the wet season resulted in complex patterns of stratification, whereas drying flattened the distribution and simplified the composition of arboreal communities. As such, pattern and process in the vertical dimension is not static in time but rather exists as a dichotomy with inverse patterns between wet and dry seasons. Complex, multidimensional distributions of diverse rainforest communities can be simplified by climatic constraints – an important consideration as anthropogenic climate change increases the magnitude of seasonal swings in temperature and precipitation.}},

abstract = {{Satellite‐derived sun‐induced chlorophyll fluorescence (SIF) has been increasingly used for estimating gross primary production (GPP). However, the relationship between SIF and GPP has not been well defined, impeding the translation of satellite observed SIF to GPP. Previous studies have generally assumed a linear relationship between SIF and GPP at daily and longer time scales, but support for this assumption is lacking. Here, we used the GPP/SIF ratio to investigate seasonal variations in the relationship between SIF and GPP over the Northern Hemisphere (NH). Based on multiple SIF products and MODIS and FLUXCOM GPP data, we found strong seasonal hump‐shaped patterns for the GPP/SIF ratio over northern latitudes, with higher values in the summer than in the spring or autumn. This hump‐shaped GPP/SIF seasonal variation was confirmed by examining different SIF products and was evident for most vegetation types except evergreen broadleaf forests. The seasonal amplitude of the GPP/SIF ratio decreased from the boreal/arctic region to drylands and the tropics. For most of the NH, the lowest GPP/SIF values occurred in October or September, while the maximum GPP/SIF values were evident in June and July. The most pronounced seasonal amplitude of GPP/SIF occurred in intermediate temperature and precipitation ranges. GPP/SIF was positively related to temperature in the early and late parts of the growing season, but not during the peak growing months. These shifting relationships between temperature and GPP/SIF across different months appeared to play a key role in the seasonal dynamics of GPP/SIF. Several mechanisms may explain the patterns we observed, and future research encompassing a broad range of climate and vegetation settings is needed to improve our understanding of the spatial and temporal relationships between SIF and GPP. Nonetheless, the strong seasonal variation in GPP/SIF we identified highlights the importance of incorporating this behavior into SIF‐based GPP estimations. Satellite‐derived sun‐induced chlorophyll fluorescence (SIF) is widely used to approximate gross primary production (GPP); however, it is unclear how the relationship between these two variables may change across different seasons. Here, we found strong seasonal hump‐shaped patterns for the GPP/SIF ratio over northern latitudes, highlighting the importance of incorporating this behavior into SIF‐based GPP estimations}},

The active CF retrievals are computationally simple but lack scalability; hence, passive measurement in terms of solar-induced chlorophyll fluorescence (SIF) from ground-based, airborne, and space-borne instruments is popular for regional or global monitoring of vegetation condition. The retrieval of SIF from upwelling radiance from vegetation canopy, though complex, is one of the promising developments in the field of remote sensing.

Using data on Finnish moth communities sampled across 65 sites for 20 years, we examine the complex synchronous/anti-synchronous relationships among sites using the geography of synchrony framework. We relate site-level synchrony to mean and temporal variation in climatic data, finding that colder and drier sites—and those with the most drastic temperature increases—are important for spatial synchrony. This suggests that faster-warming sites contribute most strongly to site-level estimates of synchrony, highlighting the role of a changing climate to spatial synchrony. Considering the spatial variability in climate change rates is therefore important to understand metacommunity dynamics and identify habitats which contribute most strongly to spatial synchrony.}},

abstract = {{ Remote sensing of far-red sun-induced chlorophyll fluorescence (SIF) has emerged as an important tool for studying gross primary productivity (GPP) at the global scale. However, the relationship between SIF and GPP at the canopy scale lacks a clear mechanistic explanation. This is largely due to the poorly characterized role of the relative contributions from canopy structure and leaf physiology to the variability of the top-of-canopy, observed SIF signal. In particular, the effect of the canopy structure beyond light absorption is that only a fraction (fesc) of the SIF emitted from all leaves in the canopy can escape from the canopy due to the strong scattering of near-infrared radiation. We combined rice, wheat and corn canopy-level in-situ datasets to study how the physiological and structural components of SIF individually relate to measures of photosynthesis. At seasonal time scales, we found a considerably strong positive correlation (R2 = 0.4–0.6) of fesc to the seasonal dynamics of the photosynthetic light use efficiency (LUEP), while the estimated physiological SIF yield was almost entirely uncorrelated to LUEP both at seasonal and diurnal time scales, with the partial exception of wheat. Consistent with these findings, the canopy structure and radiation component of SIF, defined as the product of APAR and fesc, explained the relationship of observed SIF to GPP and even outperformed GPP estimation based on observed SIF at two of the three sites investigated. These results held for both half-hourly and daily mean values. In contrast, the total emitted SIF, obtained by normalizing observed SIF for fesc, improved only the relationship to APAR but considerably decreased the correlation to GPP for all three crops. Our findings demonstrate the dominant role of canopy structure in the SIF-GPP relationship and establish a strong, mechanistic link between the near-infrared reflectance of vegetation (NIRV) and the relevant canopy structure information contained in the SIF signal. These insights are expected to be useful in improving remote sensing based GPP estimates.}},

However, the degree to which incoming solar radiation and the structure of the canopy rather than leaf physiology contribute to SIF variations is still not well characterized. Therefore, we investigated relationships between SIF and variables that at least partly capture the canopy structure component of SIF. For this, we relied on high-quality SIF observations from ground-based instruments, high-resolution airborne SIF imagery and the most recent satellite SIF products to cover large ranges in spatial and temporal resolution and diverse ecosystems. We found that the canopy structure-related near-infrared reflectance of vegetation multiplied by incoming sunlight (NIRVP) is a robust proxy for far-red SIF across a wide range of spatial and temporal scales. Our findings indicate that contributions from leaf physiology to SIF variability are small compared to the structure and radiation components. Also, NIRVP captured spatio-temporal patterns of canopy photosynthesis better than SIF, which seems to be mostly due to the greater retrieval noise of SIF. Compared to other relevant structural SIF proxies, NIRVP showed more robust relationships to SIF, especially at the global scale. Our results highlight the promise of using widely available NIRVP data for vegetation monitoring and also indicate the potential of using SIF and NIRVP in combination to extract physiological information from SIF.}},

The validation of global, satellite‐based estimates of terrestrial photosynthesis has traditionally been conducted using a network consisting of a couple of hundred observation towers. However, these towers are not uniformly distributed across Earth's biomes and are largely concentrated in North America, Europe, and East Asia. Recent advancements in the detection of solar‐induced chlorophyll fluorescence (SIF), which is emitted from plants during photosynthesis, from space now affords us an opportunity to further validate satellite‐based photosynthesis and investigate how such estimates may be improved. The recently launched TROPOspheric Monitoring Instrument (TROPOMI) provides daily global scans at a relatively high spatial resolution. Here, we compare at the global‐scale TROPOMI SIF to satellite‐based photosynthesis, vegetation indices, and estimates of the amount of sunlight absorbed by chlorophyll (APARchl), the latter two of which are used for estimating photosynthesis. Although we found TROPOMI SIF to be consistent with satellite‐based photosynthesis, vegetation indices, and APARchl, we found that SIF was better correlated with APARchl at high to mid latitude and better correlated with EVI at lower latitudes.

In addition, it remains poorly known to what extent phenological trends and their drivers differ between flowering and fruiting phases or among different growth forms. To address these knowledge gaps, we examined the reproductive phenology and potential climatic drivers in herbaceous and woody species in ecosystems across China that varied in climate (temperate to tropical) seasonality and elevation. China. We used data from the Flora Republicae Popularis Sinicae to estimate angiosperm flowering (n = 16,717 species) and fruiting (n = 11,605) phenology for 100 x 100 km grid cells (n = 943) throughout China. We assessed large‐scale geographical trends in mean flowering and fruiting date and the time needed for fruit development. The relationships of these phenological variables with seven climate variables were examined using both ordinary and spatial linear regression. Higher latitudes and elevations had considerably reduced length of the reproductive season, with later flowering and earlier fruiting than lower latitudes and elevations. Woody plant assemblages flowered markedly earlier and needed three times longer for fruit development, and tended to show steeper geographical trends in reproductive phenology than herbaceous assemblages. Herbs and woody species differed strongly in their climatic triggers of flowering but largely shared the same cues for fruiting. Woody species compensate for longer seed development times by an earlier onset of flowering, yet reproduction in both life‐forms has stronger climatic constraints. Distinct climatic drivers suggest that herbaceous and woody species assemblages will respond differently to climate change. Overall, our findings underpin the role of reproductive phenology as a key biological mechanism through which climate shapes large‐scale geographical trends in species richness, phylogenetic diversity and community assembly.}},

This global gradient suggests that lowland species have had more time to diversify, or that net diversification rates have been higher in the lowlands. However, highlands seem to be cradles of diversity as they contain many young endemics, suggesting that their rates of speciation are exceptionally fast. Here we use a phylogenetic diversification model that accounts for the dispersal of species between different elevations to examine the evolutionary dynamics of the elevational diversity gradient in passerine birds, a group that has radiated globally to occupy almost all elevations and latitudes. We find strong support for a model in which passerines diversify at the same rate in the highlands and the lowlands but in which the per-capita rate of dispersal from high to low elevations is more than twice as fast as that in the reverse direction. This suggests that while there is no consistent trend in diversification across elevations, part of the diversity generated by highland regions migrates into the lowlands, thus setting up the observed gradient in passerine diversity. We find that this process drives tropical regions but for temperate areas, the analysis could be hampered by their lower richness. Despite their lower diversity, highland regions are disproportionally important for maintaining diversity in the adjacent lowlands. Diversification does not vary consistently across elevations, but highland species are more likely to migrate than lowland species, setting up species pumps that are particularly strong in the tropics.}},

The island's mountainous regions are thought to have played a role in lineage and species diversification, but this has yet to be explored across taxonomic groups and a temporal context has not yet been identified.

Moist evergreen forests of Madagascar. Small mammals and reptiles. We analysed mitochondrial DNA data from 20 small‐mammal and five reptile species widely distributed across Madagascar's moist evergreen forests. We used phylogenetic and population genetic analyses to identify major phylogeographic patterns, then used linear regression to determine if the strength of phylogeographic structure is related to taxon, body size or elevation. Finally, we tested whether or not divergence across highlands occurred synchronously in multiple species, and used simulations to assess the power of these analyses to accurately estimate divergence times. We observed a shared phylogeographic pattern across multiple species that suggests Madagascar's northern, central and southern highlands have served as important regions of diversification on Madagascar. This pattern was recovered across taxa with varying body sizes and elevational distributions. We also identified four pulses of divergence between the northern and central highlands since the late Miocene, although simulations suggest that our empirical data cannot recover the number or timing of divergence events with high certainty. Finally, we observed several instances of deep intraspecific genetic splits, suggesting that several of the species we evaluated may represent cryptic species complexes. We identified a highland‐driven phylogeographic pattern plus several cases of cryptic endemism and recent speciation, which have important evolutionary and conservation implications. This work presents a new phylogeographic hypothesis for recent diversification on Madagascar, reaffirms the urgent need for continued collection of voucher specimens and illuminates areas of particular importance for safeguarding genetic diversity in one of the world's foremost and threatened biodiversity hotspots.}},

However, few studies have investigated the impact of breeding timing on genetic structure. We characterise the fine-scale genetic structure of a geographically-isolated population of seabirds.

Limited evidence was found for localised spatial structure, with a small number of individuals being more related to their nearest neighbours than the rest of the population.

abstract = {{Gross primary productivity (GPP) is the sum of leaf photosynthesis and represents a crucial component of the global carbon cycle. Space-borne estimates of GPP typically rely on observable quantities that co-vary with GPP such as vegetation indices using reflectance measurements (e.g., NDVI, NIRv, and kNDVI). Recent work has also utilized measurements of solar-induced chlorophyll fluorescence (SIF) as a proxy for GPP. However, these SIF measurements are typically coarse resolution while many processes influencing GPP occur at fine spatial scales. Here, we develop a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), named SIFnet, that increases the resolution of SIF from the TROPOspheric Monitoring Instrument (TROPOMI) on board of the satellite Sentinel-5P by a factor of 10 to a spatial resolution of 500 m. SIFnet utilizes coarse SIF observations together with high resolution auxiliary data. The auxiliary data used here may carry information related to GPP and SIF. We use training data from non-US regions between April 2018 until March 2021 and evaluate our CNN over the conterminous United States (CONUS). We show that SIFnet is able to increase the resolution of TROPOMI SIF by a factor of 10 with a r2 and RMSE metrics of 0.92 and 0.17 mW m−2 sr−1 nm−1, respectively. We further compare SIFnet against a recently developed downscaling approach and evaluate both methods against independent SIF measurements from Orbiting Carbon Observatory 2 and 3 (OCO-2/3). SIFnet performs systematically better than the downscaling approach (r = 0.78 for SIFnet, r = 0.72 for downscaling), indicating that it is picking up on key features related to SIF and GPP. Examination of the feature importance in the neural network indicates a few key parameters and the spatial regions these parameters matter. Namely, the CNN finds low resolution SIF data to be the most significant parameter with the NIRv vegetation index as the second most important parameter. NIRv consistently outperforms the recently proposed kNDVI vegetation index. Advantages and limitations of SIFnet are investigated and presented through a series of case studies across the United States. SIFnet represents a robust method to infer continuous, high spatial resolution SIF data.}},

Widespread field observations and remotely sensed plant phenology and physiology data across tropical forest ecosystems at various scales provide new insight into the response of tropical forests to climate change. In this study, we collected seasonal litterfall data from 65 sites across tropical/subtropical America for analysis against remotely sensed photosynthetic and climatic indicators. We proposed an integrated field and remote sensing approach for partitioning three rhythms of forest phenology across tropical and subtropical America in response to various wet- and dry-season variabilities in sunlight, liquid water supply and atmospheric dryness. The results showed that in a dry-season leaf shedding and rejuvenation phenology, trees encounter limited soil water stress, shift to a young canopy by replacing old leaves with new leaves, and regulate water use through the xylem to maximize light capture and productivity. In a wet-season leaf shedding \& rejuvenation phenology, trees on the contrary shed and rejuvenate canopy leaves to maximize light use and increase photosynthesis during the sunny wet season. Trees show a dominant stomatal regulation of seasonal water use, resulting in considerable seasonal changes in canopy photosynthesis and transpiration. However, in a dry-season leaf shedding and wet-season rejuvenation phenology, trees shed leaves due to water stresses and grew new leaves to maximize photosynthesis with sufficient water availability. Trees shift from wet-season stomatal regulation to dry-season xylem regulation with fewer canopy leaves. Our findings provide new physiological insight into the mechanism of sunlight availability, liquid water supply and atmospheric dryness in driving leaf phenology and photosynthesis across tropical and subtropical forests.}},

abstract = {{Droughts can cause dry-season productivity to decline in tropical forests. This decline occurs when precipitation is below 2,000 mm yr−1, resulting in insufficient subsurface water storage to maintain constant production through the dry season. The response of tropical forests to droughts is highly uncertain1. During the dry season, canopy photosynthesis of some tropical forests can decline, whereas in others it can be maintained at the same or a higher level than during the wet season2. However, it remains uncertain to what extent water availability is responsible for productivity declines of tropical forests during the dry season2,3. Here we use global satellite observations of two independent measures of vegetation photosynthetic properties (enhanced vegetation index from 2002 to 2012 and solar-induced chlorophyll fluorescence from 2007 to 2012) to investigate links between hydroclimate and tropical forest productivity. We find that above an annual rainfall threshold of approximately 2,000 mm yr−1, the evergreen state is sustained during the dry season in tropical rainforests worldwide, whereas below that threshold, this is not the case. Through a water-budget analysis of precipitation, potential evapotranspiration and satellite measurements of water storage change, we demonstrate that this threshold determines whether the supply of seasonally redistributed subsurface water storage from the wet season can satisfy plant water demands in the subsequent dry season. We conclude that water availability exerts a first-order control on vegetation seasonality in tropical forests globally. Our framework can also help identify where tropical forests may be vulnerable or resilient to future hydroclimatic changes.}},

abstract = {{The role of geographic barriers in promoting reproductive isolation across space is well understood. Isolation by the time of breeding, however, may also promote population divergence when populations reproduce asynchronically in space, even in the absence of geographic barriers. Few examples exist of divergence due to breeding allochrony, particularly in vertebrates. We tested whether in Neotropical frogs’ asynchrony in precipitation patterns promotes intraspecific genetic divergence, speciation, and regional accumulation of diversity. We assessed the relationship between spatial asynchrony in precipitation and genetic divergence controlling for ecological connectivity across 48 Neotropical frog species. In addition, we examined whether regions within which precipitation regimes are more asynchronous across space have higher species richness and have experienced greater speciation rates. Beyond a generalized expected effect of ecological connectivity on intraspecific genetic divergence, we found that asynchrony in precipitation is positively associated with genetic differentiation in 31\% of the species tested, resulting in a significantly positive cross-species effect of asynchrony in precipitation on genetic divergence in a meta-analysis. However, the effect of asynchrony in precipitation on population divergence seems not to scale to macroevolutionary patterns because spatial asynchrony in precipitation was not associated with geographical patterns of species richness or speciation rates. Our results indicate that genetic divergence can be promoted by asynchronous breeding lag in the absence of geographic barriers in species where breeding is associated with water availability, but such effects may not be stable enough through time to influence macroevolutionary patterns.

However, similar to many other remotely sensed metrics, SIF observations suffer from the sun‐sensor geometry effects, which may have important impacts on the SIF–GPP relationship but remain poorly understood. Here we used remotely sensed SIF, globally distributed tower GPP data, and a mechanistic model to provide a systematic analysis. Our results reveal that leaf physiology, canopy structure, and sun‐sensor geometries all affect the SIF–GPP relationship. In particular, we found that SIF observations in the sun‐tracking hotspot direction can be a better proxy of GPP due to the similar responses of light use efficiency and SIF escaping probability in the hotspot direction to the increasing incoming solar radiation. Such conclusions are supported by a variety of modeling simulations and satellite observations over various plant function types, at different time scales and with satellite observational modes. This study demonstrates the potential and advantage of normalizing SIF observations to the hotspot direction for better global GPP estimations.

Mexico, from 15° to 23° N. Ferns and lycophytes. All terrestrial and epiphytic species were recorded in 658 plots of 400 m2 along eight elevational gradients. To test whether the range size within assemblages increases with elevation and latitude, we calculated the latitudinal range using the northern and southern limits of each species and averaged the latitudinal range of all species within assemblages weighted by their abundances. We related climatic factors and the changes with latitude and elevation with range size using linear mixed‐effects models. Species richness per plot increased with elevation up to about 1,500–2,000 m, with strong differences in overall species richness between transects and a reduction with increasing latitude. The mean weighted range size of species within assemblages declined with elevation, and increased with latitude, as predicted by theory. However, we also found marked differences between the Atlantic and Pacific slopes of Mexico, as well as low range size in humid regions. The best models described about 76\%–80\% of the variability in range size and included the seasonality in both temperature and precipitation, and annual cloud cover. Latitudinal and elevational patterns of range size in fern assemblages are driven by an interplay of factors favouring wide‐ranging species (higher latitudes with increasing temperature seasonality; dryer habitat conditions) and those favouring species with restricted ranges (higher elevations; humid habitat conditions), with additional variation introduced by the specific conditions of individual mountain ranges. Climatically stable, humid habitats apparently provide favourable conditions for small‐ranged fern species, and should accordingly be given high priority in regional conservation planning.}},

Here, we document how avian functional and phylogenetic diversity and structure vary along all major elevational gradients worldwide and uncover strong latitudinal differences. Assemblages in warm tropical lowlands and cold temperate highlands are marked by high functional overdispersion and distinctiveness, whereas tropical highlands and temperate lowlands appear strongly functionally clustered and redundant. We additionally find strong geographic variation in the interplay of phylogenetic and functional structure, with strongest deviations between the two in temperate highlands. This latitudinal and elevational variation in assemblage functional structure is underpinned by nuanced shifts in the position, shape and composition of multivariate trait space. We find that, independent of latitude, high-elevation assemblages emerge as exceptionally susceptible to functional change.}},

Arguments that ancient endemic grasses formed grassland maintained by extinct grazers and fire have been persuasive. Consequent calls to repeal fire-suppression legislation, burn protected areas, and accept pastoralism as the ‘salvation’ of endemic grasses mount, even as the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) declares 98\% of lemurs face extinction through fire-driven deforestation. By analysing grass data from contemporary studies, and assessing endemic vertebrate habitat and feeding guilds, we find that although the grassland potentially dates from the Miocene, it is inhospitable to endemic vertebrates and lacks obligate grazers. Endemic grasses are absent from dominant grassland assemblages, yet not from woodland and forest assemblages. There is compelling evidence that humans entered a highland dominated by woodland and forest, and burned it; by 1000 current era (CE), grass pollens eclipsed tree pollens, reminiscent of prevailing fire-induced transformation of African miombo woodland to grassland. Endemic grasses are survivors from vanished woody habitats where grassy patches were likely small and ephemeral, precluding adaptive radiation by endemic vertebrates to form grazing-guilds. Today forests, relic tapia woodland, and outcompeted endemic grasses progressively retreat in a burning grassland dominated by non-endemic, grazing-adapted grasses and cattle.</p>}},

We explore and discuss how soil scientists can rise to the challenge both internally, in terms of our procedures and practices, and externally, in terms of our relations with colleague scientists in other disciplines, diverse groups of stakeholders and the policy arena. To meet these goals we recommend the following steps to be taken by the soil science community as a whole: (i) embrace the UN SDGs, as they provide a platform that allows soil science to demonstrate its relevance for realizing a sustainable society by 2030; (ii) show the specific value of soil science: research should explicitly show how using modern soil information can improve the results of inter- and transdisciplinary studies on SDGs related to food security, water scarcity, climate change, biodiversity loss and health threats; (iii) take leadership in overarching system analysis of ecosystems, as soils and soil scientists have an integrated nature and this places soil scientists in a unique position; (iii) raise awareness of soil organic matter as a key attribute of soils to illustrate its importance for soil functions and ecosystem services; (iv) improve the transfer of knowledge through knowledge brokers with a soil background; (v) start at the basis: educational programmes are needed at all levels, starting in primary schools, and emphasizing practical, down-to-earth examples; (vi) facilitate communication with the policy arena by framing research in terms that resonate with politicians in terms of the policy cycle or by considering drivers, pressures and responses affecting impacts of land use change; and finally (vii) all this is only possible if researchers, with soil scientists in the front lines, look over the hedge towards other disciplines, to the world at large and to the policy arena, reaching over to listen first, as a basis for genuine collaboration.}},

However, the relationships between SIF and gross primary productivity (GPP) are not fully understood, which is mainly due to the challenges of decoupling structural and physiological factors that control the relationships. Here, we report the results of continuous observations of canopy-level SIF, GPP, absorbed photosynthetically active radiation (APAR), and chlorophyll: carotenoid index (CCI) in a temperate evergreen needleleaf forest. To understand the mechanisms underlying the relationship between GPP and SIF, we investigated the relationships of light use efficiency (LUEp), chlorophyll fluorescence yield (ΦF), and the fraction of emitted SIF photons escaping from the canopy (fesc) separately. We found a strongly non-linear relationship between GPP and SIF at diurnal and seasonal time scales (R2 = 0.91 with a hyperbolic regression function, daily). GPP saturated with APAR, while SIF did not. Also, there were differential responses of LUEp and ΦF to air temperature. While LUEp reached saturation at high air temperatures, ΦF did not saturate. We found that the canopy-level chlorophyll: carotenoid index was strongly correlated to canopy-level ΦF (R2 = 0.84) implying that ΦF could be more closely related to pigment pool changes rather than LUEp. In addition, we found that the fesc contributed to a stronger SIF-GPP relationship by partially capturing the response of LUEp to diffuse light. These findings can help refine physiological and structural links between canopy-level SIF and GPP in evergreen needleleaf forest.}},

However, recent investigations found canopy structure and radiation largely control SIF, and physiological relevance of SIF remains yet to be fully understood. This study aims to evaluate whether the SIF-derived physiological signal improves quantification of crop responses to environmental stresses, by analyzing data at three different spatial scales within the U.S. Corn Belt, i.e. experiment plot, field, and regional scales, where ground-based portable, stationary and space-borne hyperspectral sensing systems are used, respectively. We found that, when controlling for variations in incoming radiation and canopy structure, crop SIF signals can be decomposed into non-physiological (i.e. canopy structure and radiation, 60\% ∼ 82\%) and physiological information (i.e. physiological SIF yield, ΦF, 17\% ∼ 31\%), which confirms the contribution of physiological variation to SIF. We further evaluated whether ΦF indicated plant responses under high-temperature and high vapor pressure deficit (VPD) stresses. The plot-scale data showed that ΦF responded to the proxy for physiological stress (partial correlation coefficient, r p= 0.40, p< 0.001) while non-physiological signals of SIF did not respond (p> 0.1). The field-scale ΦF data showed water deficit stress from the comparison between irrigated and rainfed fields, and ΦF was positively correlated with canopy-scale stomatal conductance, a reliable indicator of plant physiological condition (correlation coefficient r= 0.60 and 0.56 for an irrigated and rainfed sites, respectively). The regional-scale data showed ΦF was more strongly correlated spatially with air temperature and VPD (r= 0.23 and 0.39) than SIF (r= 0.11 and 0.34) for the U.S. Corn Belt. The lines of evidence suggested that ΦF reflects crop physiological responses to environmental stresses with greater sensitivity to stress factors than SIF, and the stress quantification capability of ΦF is spatially scalable. Utilizing ΦF for physiological investigations will contribute to improve our understanding of vegetation responses to high-temperature and high-VPD stresses.}},

Yet, ecosystems are not thermally static in space-time, especially at small scales, which might render some mountains greater thermal isolators than others. Here, we provide an extensive investigation of temperature drivers from fine to coarse scales, and demonstrate that the degree of similarity in temperatures at high and low elevations on mountains is driven by more than just absolute mountain height and latitude. We compiled a database of 29 mountains spanning 6 continents to characterize “thermal
overlap” by vertically stratified microhabitats, biomes, and owing to seasonal changes in foliage, demonstrating via mixed-effects modeling that micro- and mesogeography more strongly
influence thermal overlap than macrogeography. Impressively, an increase of one meter of vertical microhabitat height generates an increase in overlap equivalent to a 5.26° change in latitude. In addition, forested mountains have reduced thermal overlap – 149\% lower – relative to non-forested mountains. We provide evidence in support of a climate hypothesis that emphasizes
microgeography as a determinant of dispersal, demographics, and behavior, thereby refining classical theory of macroclimate variability as a prominent driver of biogeography.}},

abstract = {{Global precipitation patterns lead to differences in seasonal distributions of rainfall between locations in the form of alternating dry and wet seasons. Many locations experience a single wet and dry season per year, but some studies report the occurrence of two wet and dry seasons per year. This bimodal rainfall pattern is commonly associated with locations within the tropics but is reported outside the tropics as well. However, this information is fragmented, and studies of bimodality are mainly restricted to monthly rainfall totals. Here, we use a gridded global data set and simple harmonic analysis to provide a systematic overview of global bimodal rainfall and rain‐day frequency. We find good agreement between the various regional studies concerning bimodal precipitation and our global overview, showing that bimodal rainfall occurs on approximately 7\% of the global land surface. In the tropics, regions of bimodal rainfall totals (P) and regions of bimodal rain‐day frequency (N) tend to overlap due to the presence of dry seasons that have zero precipitation. Outside the tropics, P and N are more independent, which leads to complex within‐year patterns of precipitation intensity. A secondary outcome of our results is an improved low‐dimensional global parameterization of monthly rainfall regimes. Our results provide the first gridded global overview of bimodal rainfall patterns and show the usefulness of simple mathematical approaches for detecting patterns in large data sets. This study uses gridded data and very simple mathematical analysis to create a first global overview of regions with bimodal precipitation seasonality. Approximately 7.1\% of the global land surface is identified as having bimodal rainfall regimes. Sensitivity analysis shows that this seasonal pattern is relatively clear in the tropics, while outside the tropics, inter‐annual variability can obscure within‐year seasonal patterns.}},

This study investigates the dynamic relationship between SIF and Vcmax and its controlling factors using SIF and CO2 response measurements in rice. The results show that SIF and its yield (SIFy) are strongly correlated with Vcmax during the growing season, though the relationship varies with rice growth stages. After flowering, SIFy has a stronger relationship with Vcmax than SIF flux does at both leaf and canopy levels. Further analysis suggests that changes in canopy structure and leaf physiology lead to the divergence of the link between SIF and Vcmax from leaf to canopy. Our findings highlight the need to account for plant physiology and canopy structure in interpreting the SIF signal across spatial scales. Our observation-based results provide evidence that remotely sensed SIF observations can be used to track seasonal variations of Vcmax at the leaf and canopy levels.</p>}},

However, SIF-GPP relationships are mostly built by statistically relating top-of-canopy (TOC) SIF observations (SIFTOC) to eddy covariance flux-tower GPP estimates. We developed a process-based model, based on the mechanistic light response (MLR) model, to mechanistically link SIFTOC with the photosynthetic activity of vegetation. To apply this mechanistic model at the canopy scale, we 1) reformulate the equations by replacing the fraction of open PSII reaction centers (q L) and the maximum quantum yield of photosystem II (ФPmax) with nonphotochemical quenching (NPQ) and the quantum yield of photosystem II (ΦP); 2) reconstruct hemispherical broadband SIF fluxes at photosystem II (PSII) from the directional observed SIFTOC that is contributed from photosystem I and II; 3) estimate other key parameters including KDF (ratio between the rate constants for constitutive heat loss and fluorescence), C c (chloroplastic CO2 partial pressure), and Γ* (chloroplastic compensation point of CO2) at the canopy scale based on assumptions and in-situ measurements. A comparison against flux-tower based GPP at a winter-wheat study site, demonstrates that the modeled GPP, driven by SIFTOC at 760 nm, air temperature, incoming photosynthetically active radiation (PAR), and directional reflectance in the red and near-infrared region, is able to quantify canopy photosynthesis with good accuracy at both half-hourly (R 2 = 0.85, RMSE = 5.62 μmol m−2 s−1, rRMSE = 9.10\%) and daily (R 2 > 0.90, RMSE = 3.25 μmol m−2 s−1 and rRMSE = 8.69\%) scales.

The non-linearity between SIF and GPP at the canopy level was often observed in many previous studies, but the non-linearity between SIFtotal and GPP has not yet been systematically investigated. In this study, based on a theoretical analysis of the relationship between SIF and GPP at the leaf level and how it propagates to the canopy level with the consideration of sunlit and shaded leaf fractions in the canopy, we asserted that non-linear relationships between SIFtotal and GPP at the canopy level are general and physically sound. We derived SIFtotal from two different approaches using TROPOMI SIF data. One is based on the canopy escape ratio of SIF signals observed by satellite sensors (SIFobs), and the other is an angular normalization method. At the site level, we established linear and non-linear (exponential, hyperbolic, and polynomial) regressions between TROPOMI SIF and GPP data from 25 flux tower sites covering the eight biomes. The results indicate that non-linearity between SIFtotal and GPP exists among eight major biomes, and exponential regression is the best regression method to capture the non-linearity between SIF and GPP at the site level. We developed a simple variable, SIFnon-linear, to capture the non-linearity between SIFtotal and GPP. R2 values of the linear correlations between SIFnon-linear and GPP are equal or close to those of exponential correlations between SIFtotal and GPP. SIFnon-linear captures the non-linearity well, even though different biomes have different degrees of non-linearity. On the global scale, TROPOMI SIF was compared with GPP simulations of the BEPS model and the SMAP GPP product, showing that SIFnon-linear is a better proxy of GPP than SIFobs and SIFtotal. We find that the non-linearity between SIFtotal and GPP generally exists among eight major biomes regardless of the spatial or temporal scales. The non-linearity is driven by the seasonal variation of the absorbed photosynthetically active radiation (APAR). The degree of the non-linearity varies among different biomes, and it is controlled by three factors: the light saturation point of GPP, the variation of APAR during the growing season, and the ratio between the sunlit and shaded portion of the canopy. Temporal aggregation of SIFtotal reduces the non-linearity. Our results indicate that the simple variable SIFnon-linear can replace SIFobs or SIFtotal to improve global SIF-GPP related studies in the future.}},

Tropical trees grow, on average, two times faster compared to trees from temperate and boreal biomes and live significantly shorter, on average (186 ± 138 y compared to 322 ± 201 y outside the tropics). At the global scale, growth rates and longevity covary strongly with temperature. Within the warm tropical lowlands, where broadleaf species dominate the vegetation, we find consistent decreases in tree longevity with increasing aridity, as well as a pronounced reduction in longevity above mean annual temperatures of 25.4 °C. These independent effects of temperature and water availability on tree longevity in the tropics are consistent with theoretical predictions of increases in evaporative demands at the leaf level under a warmer and drier climate and could explain observed increases in tree mortality in tropical forests, including the Amazon, and shifts in forest composition in western Africa. Our results suggest that conditions supporting only lower tree longevity in the tropical lowlands are likely to expand under future drier and especially warmer climates.}},

abstract = {{Many studies have shown that solar-induced fluorescence (SIF) has a good potential to predict gross primary production (GPP) of vegetation. What we measured by remote sensing or near-surface platforms is top-of-canopy (TOC) SIF (SIFtoc), which is not necessarily equal or proportional to total emitted SIF (SIFtot) from the entire canopy due to the (re)absorption and scattering effects. However, photosynthesis, the process that plants use to fix carbon from the atmosphere, occurs at the entire vertical canopy. Here, by using the recollision theory, we calculated SIFtot at 760 nm from the measured SIFtoc, hyperspectral reflectance (R), canopy interception (i) and leaf albedo (ωl). Among them, both SIFtoc and R can be obtained from concurrent TOC spectral measurements; i and ωl in the near-infrared region can be estimated from the open access datasets with a good accuracy. Our result confirms that the measured SIFtoc only accounts for a small fraction of SIFtot: the above-the-canopy sensor can only “see” on average 22.9\% of SIFtot at Harvard Forest. SIFtot has the following advantages over SIFtoc in estimating GPP: (1) SIFtot improves the diurnal estimate of canopy GPP, especially capable to capture the midday depression of photosynthesis which may cause the large discrepancies between SIFtoc and GPP on a diurnal basis, (2) SIFtot produces a stronger correlation with GPP from plants with complex canopy structure or under sky conditions with more diffuse irradiance, and (3) the SIFtot-GPP relationship shows a stronger resilience to environmental stresses. The fluorescence escape ratio (fesc), the ratio between SIFtoc multiplied by π and SIFtot, is mostly determined by the sun-canopy-sensor geometry and leaf inclination distribution. The effect of LAI and the leaf chlorophyll concentration on fesc is marginal at the 760 nm wavelength. Our results suggest that converting SIFtoc into SIFtot provides a better tool to understand and estimate GPP.}},

abstract = {{ Transpiration (T) returns about half of continental precipitation back into the atmosphere. However, the global spatial and temporal dynamics of transpiration are highly uncertain, and current estimates rely on either indirect remote sensing or empirical model formulations. Here, we show that T can be estimated reliably at the global scale using observations of plant sun-induced fluorescence (SIF). To do so, we derive T using two different methods from globally-distributed eddy-covariance measurements and compare it with satellite SIF retrievals from GOME-2 and OCO-2. Whereas most research to date has focused on the link between SIF and gross primary production (GPP), we demonstrate that SIF is as highly correlated with T (mean correlation coefficient R of 0.76 across sites for 16-day periods with GOME-2 and 0.75 at the daily scale with OCO-2). SIF shows a greater predictive skill to estimate T than traditional optical vegetation indices and its dynamics are very similar to those of T. Through the use of an advanced radiative transfer model, we also demonstrate a clear empirical link between SIF and T. At 83 FLUXNET sites, remote sensing data and flux-derived GPP and T are used to estimate the relevant parameters of the Soil Canopy Observation of Photosynthesis and Energy fluxes (SCOPE) radiative transfer model and to model SIF. While the relationship between SIF and photosynthesis (GPP) is mostly controlled by leaf biochemical properties and plant structure, the SIF–T relationship appears largely determined by air temperature and intrinsic water use efficiency. Our findings suggest that ongoing advances in satellite SIF retrievals will allow for a more direct estimation of transpiration over large scales.}},

abstract = {{Species phenology plays a key role in determining mutualistic interactions, such as those between plants and pollinators. Notably, temporal synchrony shapes the patterns of interactions by influencing the probability of encounters between interacting partners; thus, species phenology greatly contributes to structuring ecological communities. In these communities, specialized species are expected to show a high level of synchrony with their partners; however, the relationship between species phenology and specialization remains largely unexplored. In three localities in the tropical mountains of Costa Rica, we quantified the level of phenological synchrony in plant–pollinator networks and tested whether phenological synchrony is associated with the degree of pollinator specialization on plant partners. We also tested the relationship between pollinator specialization and the length of the flowering phase of the visited plants. Across all three studied networks, our results show a strong asynchrony between interacting plant and pollinator species. We also found that more specialized pollinators were more asynchronous with their plant partners and, moreover, that specialized pollinators preferably visited plant species with shorter flowering phases compared to generalized pollinators. These patterns suggest that specialized pollinators may be more vulnerable to mutualistic disruptions because they depend primarily on short‐lived resources and have a high risk of phenological mismatch. This discovery has important consequences for specialized species’ potential to survive and adapt to changes in the phenology of their interacting partners, which is highly relevant in a time characterized by changing climates and associated shifts in species phenology.}},

That conclusion is bolstered by the absence of robust multidecadal climate oscillations in control simulations of current-generation models. Paleoclimate data, however, do demonstrate multidecadal oscillatory behavior during the preindustrial era. By comparing control and forced “Last Millennium” simulations, we show that these apparent multidecadal oscillations are an artifact of pulses of volcanic activity during the preindustrial era that project markedly onto the multidecadal (50- to 70-year) frequency band.

We predicted that tropical montane biotas would have (a) overall higher Tβ, Pβ and Fβ, (b) faster distance decay patterns and (c) higher within‐mountain variability in pairwise β‐diversity. Furthermore, we expected the richness component βrich to be more important in temperate mountains, and the replacement component βrepl in tropical mountains. Latitude had a negative effect on total β‐diversity for all dimensions of diversity. Similarly, metrics of Tβ and Pβ mostly agree with our expectations, whereas Fβ showed contrasting results with steeper distance decay curves and higher within‐mountain variability in temperate mountains. Overall, βrich was a more important component at high elevations in the tropics and across elevations in temperate mountains, and βrepl was more important in tropical low and mid‐elevations. Our findings are consistent with tropical mountain assemblages containing species with narrow elevational distributions, low dispersal ability and potentially high allopatric speciation, resulting in high β‐diversity across elevations. Contrasting results for Fβ indicate high niche packing in tropical assemblages, with most changes in functional diversity among assemblages involving species redundant in trait space.}},

We expected that species phenologies would be better explained by variation in temperature and PAR than rainfall because rainfall at this site is not limiting. The best‐fit model for all four species included temperature, rainfall, and PAR. For three species, including two foundational species of Hawaiian forests (Acacia koa and Metrosideros polymorpha), seed production declined with increasing maximum temperatures and increased with rainfall. Relationships with PAR were the most variable across all four species.

There was considerable variation in monthly seed and leaf production not explained by climatic factors, and there was some evidence for a mediating effect of daylength. Thus, the impact of future climate change on this forest will depend on how climate change interacts with other factors such as daylength, biotic, and/or evolutionary constraints.

abstract = {{Sun-induced chlorophyll fluorescence (SIF) retrieved from satellites has shown potential as a remote sensing proxy for gross primary productivity (GPP). However, to fully exploit the potential of this signal, the robustness and stability of the SIF-GPP relationship across vegetation types and climates must be assessed. For this purpose, current studies have been limited by the availability of SIF datasets with sufficient spatial resolution to disentangle the signal between different vegetation cover types. To overcome this limitation our analysis uses GOME-2 SIF retrievals, downscaled to a resolution of 0.05° (∼5 km) to explore the relationship between SIF and FLUXCOM GPP (GPPFX), a data-driven dataset of primary productivity obtained by upscaling flux-tower measurements. The high resolution of the downscaled SIF (SIFDS) dataset allows the relationships to be broken down by vegetation cover for separate climate zones, thus enabling a confrontation between GPP and SIF at fine granularity,and the comparison and categorisation of vegetation covers based on the SIFDS-GPPFX response. This analysis first investigates the spatial and temporal relationships between FLUXCOM GPP and downscaled SIF at a global scale. Divergences and convergences between the two datasets are explored to see where high-resolution SIF can enhance our understanding of GPP. A reasonably strong linear relationship is generally observed between SIFDS and GPPFX in all vegetation categories, and an analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) shows that the spatial response is similar between certain plant traits, with some exceptions, such as equatorial broadleaf forests, and continental needleleaf forests, and distinction between woody and herbaceous vegetation. The temporal relationship between SIFDS and GPPFX, within a growing season, is shown to be the strongest, followed by the spatial relationship and finally the SIFDS-GPPFX trend between growing seasons. Whilst a linear spatial relationship is generally observed between SIFDS and GPPFX in all vegetation categories, geographical regions of non-linearity suggest where SIFDS could potentially provide information about ecosystem dynamics that are not represented in the FLUXCOM GPP dataset. With the demonstration of downscaled SIF as a proxy for GPP, the response of SIFDS to short-term fluctuations in several meteorological variables is analysed, and the utility of SIFDS as a measure of environmental stress explored. For a broad range of land cover categories, the most significant environmental driving and limiting meteorological variables are determined and vegetation groupings of similar SIF-meteo response reinforce the vegetation categorisations suggested by the SIF-GPP ANCOVA. This comparative exploration of two of the most recent products in carbon productivity estimation shows the value in downscaling SIF data, provides an independent probe of the FLUXCOM GPP model, enhances our understanding of the global SIF-GPP spatio-temporal relationship with a particular focus on the role of vegetation cover, and demonstrates the utility of SIF as a measure of environmental stress.}},

abstract = {{Africa is forecasted to experience large and rapid climate change 1 and population growth 2 during the twenty-first century, which threatens the world's second largest rainforest. Protecting and sustainably managing these African forests requires an increased understanding of their compositional heterogeneity, the environmental drivers of forest composition and their vulnerability to ongoing changes. Here, using a very large dataset of 6 million trees in more than 180,000 field plots, we jointly model the distribution in abundance of the most dominant tree taxa in central Africa, and produce continuous maps of the floristic and functional composition of central African forests. Our results show that the uncertainty in taxon-specific distributions averages out at the community level, and reveal highly deterministic assemblages. We uncover contrasting floristic and functional compositions across climates, soil types and anthropogenic gradients, with functional convergence among types of forest that are floristically dissimilar. Combining these spatial predictions with scenarios of climatic and anthropogenic global change suggests a high vulnerability of the northern and southern forest margins, the Atlantic forests and most forests in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, where both climate and anthropogenic threats are expected to increase sharply by 2085. These results constitute key quantitative benchmarks for scientists and policymakers to shape transnational conservation and management strategies that aim to provide a sustainable future for central African forests. Concomitant increases in climate stress, human population needs and resource extraction in central Africa raise environmental concerns 3-5. These threats may have considerable impacts on the carbon budget 6 , climate 7 and biodiversity of central African forests 8 , which shelter some of the world's most iconic wildlife species and which are already experiencing a much drier and seasonal climate than other tropical forests 9. However, the current composition of central African forests and its determinants at regional scale are still poorly known, often being studied in limited areas 10-12 and datasets 13 or at a very coarse grain with heterogeneous occurrence records 14. Vast regions of central African forests remain poorly explored scientifically 15 , and most space-borne systems of Earth observation provide very limited information on forest composition 16. This hinders our ability to understand how the composition and functions of forests vary regionally, to forecast how these forests will face upcoming global changes and, ultimately, to anticipate-on scientific bases-how to protect and manage them beyond national boundaries. In this study, we used an extensive dataset of forest inventories to (1) model the main floristic and functional gradients over central African forests; and (2) assess their expected vulnerability under forecasted conditions of global (climatic and anthropogenic) change. We compiled the abundance distributions of 193 dominant tree taxa in 185,665 field plots (around 90,000 ha) from commercial forest inventories spread over the 5 main forested countries in central Africa (Cameroon, Central African Republic, Democratic Republic of the Congo, Gabon and Republic of the Congo) (Extended Data Fig. 1).

We also discuss key considerations for tropical ecologists looking to use rainfall metrics that better align with hypothesized biological or ecological mechanisms or that more effectively describe rainfall variability in the systems we study and provide a toolkit (R scripts and gridded datasets) to do so. We argue that incorporating more sophisticated approaches to quantify rainfall variability into study design and statistical analyses will enhance our understanding of past, ongoing, and future changes in tropical ecosystems. Abstract in Spanish is available with online material. Durante mucho tiempo en la ecología tropical se ha considerado que la variabilidad de la lluvia representa un filtro ambiental que determina la distribución, estructura y función de los ecosistemas tropicales en el espacio y en el tiempo. Sin embargo, históricamente se han utilizado un número limitado de variables, como la precipitación media anual (PMA) y la duración de la estación seca para caracterizar como la lluvia varía a través de sus múltiples dimensiones. En el presente artículo se revisan diferentes métodos para cuantificar la variabilidad de la lluvia a través de escalas temporales, haciendo énfasis en sus aplicaciones metodológicas. Adicionalmente, sugerimos puntos claves para el uso de métricas que mejoran la predicción de procesos biológicos y ecológicos. Estas métricas describen de una mejor manera la variabilidad de la lluvia en los ecosistemas tropicales, para su implementación proveemos códigos de R y datos en raster. Finalmente, proponemos que la incorporación de métricas más sofisticadas para cuantificar la variabilidad de las precipitaciones mejorará nuestra comprensión de los cambios que han experimentado y experimentarán los ecosistemas tropicales.}},

To provide conservation managers with an evidence-based approach to identifying refuges and refugia, we ask: which places have been observed to function as refuges/refugia, with results reported in the scientific literature? We systematically reviewed the past 20 years of research into refuges/refugia. To provide an objective picture of the evidence for different refuges/refugia, we analysed each study using the framework of: (a) the place providing protection and its environmental characteristics; (b) the threat; and (c) the biota being protected. We identified 16 categories of places which functioned as refuges/refugia. These places occurred at spatial scales varying from within-habitat elements (e.g., crevices and burrows) to regions, and functioned at temporal scales from minutes to millennia. Most studies focused on large-scale, geographically specific places (mainly glacial refugia) or small-scale within-habitat refuges; relatively few studies described environmental characteristics of the refuges/refugia. However, three landscape elements: rocky environments, montane environments and riparian areas (and other terrestrial wet-spots), were identified as refuges/refugia for multiple species and threats. Conservation managers seeking to increase the resistance of local biodiversity can act now to protect these places within their sphere of influence. Clearly describing of refuges/refugia in terms of place (and environmental characteristics), threat and biota protected, enables application of research findings beyond individual study sites, and provides direction for evidence-based conservation management.}},

To analyze isolation by distance from molecular data, one can use some kind of genetic distance or coalescent simulations. Molecular markers can often display technical caveats, such as PCR-based amplification failures (null alleles, allelic dropouts). These problems can alter population parameter inferences that can be extracted from molecular data. In this simulation study, we analyze the behavior of different genetic distances in Island (null hypothesis) and stepping stone models displaying varying neighborhood sizes. Impact of null alleles of increasing frequency is also studied. In stepping stone models without null alleles, the best statistic to detect isolation by distance in most situations is the chord distance D CSE. Nevertheless, for markers with genetic diversities H S <0.4-0.5, all statistics tend to display the same statistical power. Marginal sub-populations behave as smaller neighborhoods. Metapopulations composed of small sub-population numbers thus display smaller neighborhood sizes. When null alleles are introduced, the power of detection of isolation by distance is significantly reduced and D CSE remains the most powerful genetic distance. We also show that the proportion of null allelic states interact with the slope of the regression of F ST /(1-F ST) as a function of geographic distance. This can have important consequences on inferences that can be made from such data. Nevertheless, Chapuis and Estoup's FreeNA correction for null alleles provides very good results in most situations. We finally use our conclusions for reanalyzing and reinterpreting some published data sets.}},

ET, however, remains one of the most uncertain hydrological variables at the global scale. In this study, we proposed a semi-mechanistic model for estimating terrestrial T by deriving an analytical solution between solar-induced chlorophyll fluorescence (SIF) and stomatal conductance (gc) as well as vapor pressure deficit (VPD), combining theories on the photosynthetic pathway and optimal stomatal behavior. The relationships of SIF-ETR and ETR-gc·VPD0.5 was calibrated by the Soil-Canopy Observation of Photosynthesis and Energy (SCOPE) model. This model was validated by hourly canopy SIF and concurrent eddy covariance flux observations at both forest and cropland ecosystems. Results showed that the SIF combined with VPD can better predict gc than using SIF alone with a more consistent seasonal trends found in both SIF and gc·VPD0.5. The correlation between gc·VPD0.5 and SIF was stronger than those between gc and SIF and between gc and VIs. Canopy T was accurately predicted from SIF at both hourly (R2 > 0.65) and daily (R2 > 0.76) scales and was also successfully estimated using SIF observations from the TROPOspheric Monitoring Instrument (TROPOMI) at cropland ecosystems. In comparison with empirical relationships of directly linking gc with SIF or VIs, the proposed model produced latent heat flux (λE) estimation in best agreement with measured values at all three sites. Our model could be a step forward in understanding the coupling of carbon and water cycles and may be used in ecosystem models for improving ET estimation over large areas.}},

abstract = {{<p>Insectivorous birds reach their highest diversity in the tropics and represent a striking variety of morphological and behavioral specializations for foraging, yet explanations for these patterns are inadequate because of both our limited understanding of the drivers of ecological diversification within and among clades and of coexistence mechanisms in particular. Here we synthesize recent information on Neotropical insectivorous birds, including their diversity, evolutionary ages and locations of origin, phylogenies, and both competitive and predator–prey species interactions. We propose a novel evolutionary hypothesis for the origin and coexistence of the phenotypic diversity of insectivore foraging morphologies in species-rich communities, based on their extraordinary food-resource specializations. Specifically, we develop the Biotic Challenge Hypothesis to explain the evolution of these specializations, and we provide preliminary evidence in support of this hypothesis based on a synopsis of both Neotropical insectivore specializations by family and arthropod antipredator adaptations by category. We argue that, from the perspective of tropical insectivorous birds, and particularly in the most species-rich, mainland Neotropical communities, the environment is an arthropod desert. Coexistence with all of the other insectivores requires feeding specialization to compete exploitatively and diffusely against evolutionarily diverse species and far less frequently against sister species. The arthropod desert arises primarily because of (1) the tactical diversity of arthropod predators as insectivore competitors and (2) the evolutionary arms races involving arthropod predators with their prey, which render many arthropods inaccessible to most insectivorous predators. Our idea provides an explicit mechanism for pervasive, diffuse tropical interspecific competition, for evolutionary specialization, and for positive feedback on speciation rates at low latitudes, thereby generating new predictions and insights into tropical life histories and the Latitudinal Diversity Gradient. Other recent ideas concerning the coexistence of Neotropical insectivores, including positive species interactions within mixed species flocks, are recognized and evaluated. We discuss ways to test predictions resulting from the new view of communities developed here, including a case study of diet specialization by Costa Rican tyrannid flycatchers. Our synthesis of the origin and nature of Neotropical insectivore communities injects new life into the “zombie” idea that evolution works differently in the species-rich tropics.</p>}},

abstract = {{Rates of species formation vary widely across the tree of life and contribute to massive disparities in species richness among clades. This variation can emerge from differences in metapopulation-level processes that affect the rates at which lineages diverge, persist, and evolve reproductive barriers and ecological differentiation. For example, populations that evolve reproductive barriers quickly should form new species at faster rates than populations that acquire reproductive barriers more slowly. This expectation implicitly links microevolutionary processes (the evolution of populations) and macroevolutionary patterns (the profound disparity in speciation rate across taxa). Here, leveraging extensive field sampling from the Neotropical Cerrado biome in a biogeographically controlled natural experiment, we test the role of an important microevolutionary process—the propensity for population isolation—as a control on speciation rate in lizards and snakes. By quantifying population genomic structure across a set of codistributed taxa with extensive and phylogenetically independent variation in speciation rate, we show that broad-scale patterns of species formation are decoupled from demographic and genetic processes that promote the formation of population isolates. Population isolation is likely a critical stage of speciation for many taxa, but our results suggest that interspecific variability in the propensity for isolation has little influence on speciation rates. These results suggest that other stages of speciation—including the rate at which reproductive barriers evolve and the extent to which newly formed populations persist—are likely to play a larger role than population isolation in controlling speciation rate variation in squamates.}},

Sun-Induced Chlorophyll Fluorescence (SIF) has been found closely linked to vegetation photosynthetic activity. But the application of SIF for direct estimation of Gross Primary Productivity (GPP) is not well investigated. In this study, we demonstrate the estimation of GPP for tropical deciduous forests located in North Western Himalayan Foothills in India using simulated SIF and fluorescence quantum yield (ФF) through a modified Light Use Efficiency (LUEf) model. SIF simulated using Soil Canopy Observation, Photochemistry, and Energy fluxes (SCOPE) model provided the estimate of Photosynthetically Active Radiation (PAR) intercepted by the canopy foliage and ФF. ФF, measured through the Pulse-Amplitude Modulated (PAM) fluorometer quantifies the emission rate of SIF per unit of the absorbed photon. The integration of these factors into the proposed LUEf model offered real-time photosynthetic efficiency and improved the estimate of GPP of the deciduous forest. The results show that GPP estimated from SIF (SIFTOC) was closely related to GPPEddy with R2 = 0.91 (p<0.05) with RMSE= 29.24 gC m −2 month−1 than GPP estimated from LUE model (R2=0. 79, p<0.05) and RMSE = 96.25 gC m −2 month−1). GPPMODIS underestimated the GPP with a non-significant correlation to GPPEddy for all the months with R2=0. 36 (p<0.05) and RMSE = 188.96 gC m −2 month−1.

The temporal overlap and divergence in flowering along latitudinal gradients is tightly related to intraspecific gene flow and interspecific interactions. Recent studies have predicted that global warming has led to more uniform spring and summer plant phenology across latitudes, but direct evidence is limited. Here, we test changes in the latitudinal pattern of peak flowering of a perennial herb Spiranthes sinensis (Orchidaceae) during 1901–2017 across \textbackslashtextasciitilde40° of latitude in eastern Asia, spanning humid to water-limited regions. We found that flowering phenology did not vary significantly across latitudes in water-limited regions. However, global warming has significantly increased temporal divergence in flowering phenology across latitudes in humid regions—each 1 °C warming in mean annual temperature leads to an increased divergence of 2.47 days across 1° of latitude. Significantly stronger temperature sensitivity at lower latitudes is likely responsible for the increased phenological divergence. Additionally, we found that the phenological divergence is larger at lower latitudes in humid regions. These findings provide empirical evidence of variation in the latitudinal phenology shift at longer temporal and larger spatial scales under climate change, and highlight its potential role in ecosystem functioning, such as intraspecific gene flow and interspecific interaction.}},

Here we investigate diversification in Rhinella granulosa, a Neotropical toad from northeastern Brazil, by testing a range of hypotheses that encompass different putative mechanisms reducing gene flow among populations. We sequenced single nucleotide polymorphisms and examined individual predictions related to the role of geographic barriers (rivers), ecological gradients, historical habitat stability, and spatial variation in climate seasonality, also known as the asynchrony of seasons hypothesis. This hypothesis postulates that temporal asynchrony of wet and dry seasons over short distances causes parapatric populations to become isolated by time. After determining genetic structure, inferring past distributions, ranking demographic models, and estimating the power of monthly climatic variables, our results identified two populations that are not associated with geographic barriers, biome gradients, or historical refugia. Instead, they are predicted by spatial variation in monthly rainfall and minimum temperature, consistent with the asynchrony of seasons hypothesis, supported also by our comparative framework using multiple matrix regression and linear mixed effects modeling. Due to the toad’s life history, climate likely mediates gene flow directly, with genetic differentiation being provoked by neutral mechanisms related to climate driven population isolation, and/or by natural selection against migrants from populations with different breeding times. The asynchrony of seasons hypothesis is seldom considered in phylogeographic studies, but our results indicate that it should be tested in systems where breeding is tightly coupled with climate.}},

abstract = {{Fine‐scale climate information is critical to understand species–climate relationships. It is usually obtained by interpolating meteorological station data or by downscaling coarse‐gridded climate data. In mountain areas, however, the low station density and macroclimate variables used in coarse‐gridded climate products cannot reproduce fine‐scale variations caused by the complex topography and thus result in biased predictions of species responses to climate change. Here, we present an innovative method to estimate daily local air temperature at 100 m spatial resolution in the mountain region of South Tyrol (Central Alps, Italy), called the cloud‐corrected model. We introduce a correction factor that couples solar radiation and cloud cover data to improve air temperature predictions. Results are compared to models that either consider elevation only (lapse‐rate model) or elevation and solar radiation but not cloud cover (clear‐sky model) using a set of independent meteorological stations for validation. Moreover, all models were tested to predict critical phenological stages of the climate‐sensitive species Vitis vinifera. Over the vegetative period, the cloud‐corrected model significantly reduced the mean absolute error of predicted temperature compared with the lapse rate and clear‐sky model by 10 and 23\%, respectively, and the bias by 93 and 90\%, respectively. Solar radiation and cloud cover both strongly influenced local air temperature and their inclusion in temperature estimates greatly reduced systematic biases and improved predictions of important plant phenological stages by multiple days. Our method therefore provides a new way to include easily accessible topography and climate data into fine‐scale temperature predictions and accounts for important climate forcing factors that otherwise are often neglected. It combines efficiency and accuracy, because it limits data requirements but still operates on an ecologically relevant spatial scale. Thus, our approach offers promising opportunities to improve the understanding of species–climate relationships, especially in regions sensitive to the effects of climate change. Mountain terrain is characterized by fine‐scale climate variability related to topography, but most climate data do not account for these topoclimatic differences. We therefore present a new method to predict local air temperature at high spatiotemporal resolution over mountain topography that also includes often‐neglected climate forcing factors, such as solar radiation and cloud cover. Our topoclimate model requires minimal input data and is thus easily transferable to different regions but can still be applied on a very fine spatial scale.}},

abstract = {{Tropical ecosystems strongly influence Earth's climate and weather patterns. Most tropical ecosystems remain warm year‐round; nonetheless, their plants undergo seasonal cycles of carbon and water exchange. Previous research has shown the importance of precipitation and radiation as drivers of the seasonality of photosynthetic activity in the tropics. Although data are scarce, field‐based studies have found that seasonal cycles at a handful of tropical sites do not match those in the land surface model (LSM) simulations. A comprehensive understanding and model comparison of how seasonal variations in tropical photosynthetic activity relate to climate is lacking. Here, we identify the relationships of precipitation and radiation with satellite‐based proxies for photosynthetic activity (e.g., GOME‐2 SIF, MAIAC EVI) for the pantropical region. Three dominant and spatially distinct seasonal relationships emerge: photosynthetic activity that is positively correlated with both drivers (36\% of tropical pixels), activity that increases following rain but decreases with radiation (28\%), and activity that increases following bright seasons but decreases with rain (14\%). We compare distributions of these observed relationships with those from LSMs. In general, compared to satellite‐based proxies of photosynthetic activity, model simulations of gross primary productivity (GPP) overestimate the extent of positive correlations of photosynthetic activity with water and underestimate positive correlations with radiation. The largest discrepancies between simulations and observations are in the representation of regions where photosynthetic activity increases with radiation and decreases with rain. Our clear scheme for representing the relationship between climate and photosynthetic activity can be used to benchmark tropical seasonality of GPP in LSMs. Tropical ecosystems strongly influence Earth's atmosphere and climate through their high rates of photosynthesis and transpiration. These rates vary seasonally, but tropical seasonal cycles and their drivers are incompletely characterized. Here, we identify and characterize the three most common relationships between seasonality of photosynthetic activity and the availability of two main climate‐related resources, water, and sunlight. Each type of relationship is associated with specific climate properties. In short, when seasonal cycles of rain and sunlight are synchronized, vegetation responds positively to both drivers. When the cycles are not synchronized, drier sites respond positively to rain and negatively to light, while wetter sites respond positively to light and negatively to rainfall. Ecosystem models generally lack the mechanisms that lead to this latter relationship. Our improved understanding of these relationships can guide model improvement efforts for tropical ecosystems. In most of the tropics, photosynthesis varies with seasonal fluctuation in both resources, but relationships with one driver are common The relationship of climate with photosynthetic activity is characterized by water availability and its synchronization with radiation Land surface models overestimate the extent of positive correlations with precipitation and underestimate those with radiation In most of the tropics, photosynthesis varies with seasonal fluctuation in both resources, but relationships with one driver are common The relationship of climate with photosynthetic activity is characterized by water availability and its synchronization with radiation Land surface models overestimate the extent of positive correlations with precipitation and underestimate those with radiation}},

abstract = {{ Solar-induced chlorophyll fluorescence (SIF) measured from space has been increasingly used to quantify plant photosynthesis at regional and global scales. Apparent canopy SIF yield (SIFyield apparent), determined by fluorescence yield (ΦF) and escaping ratio (fesc), together with absorbed photosynthetically active radiation (APAR), is crucial in driving spatio-temporal variability of SIF. While strong linkages between SIFyield apparent and plant physiological responses and canopy structure have been suggested, spatio-temporal variability of SIFyield apparent at regional scale remains largely unclear, which limits our understanding of the spatio-temporal variability of SIF and its relationship with photosynthesis. In this study, we utilized recent SIF data with high spatial resolution from two satellite instruments, OCO-2 and TROPOMI, together with multiple other datasets. We estimated SIFyield apparent across space, time, and different vegetation types in the U.S. Midwest during crop growing season (May to September) from 2015 to 2018. We found that SIFyield apparent of croplands was larger than non-croplands during peak season (July–August). However, SIFyield apparent between corn (C4 crop) and soybean (C3 crop) did not show a significant difference. SIFyield apparent of corn, soybean, forest, and grass/pasture show clear seasonal and spatial patterns. The spatial variability of precipitation during the growing season could explain the overall spatial pattern of SIFyield apparent. Further analysis by decomposing SIFyield apparent into ΦF and fesc using near-infrared reflectance of vegetation (NIRV) suggests that fesc may be the major driver of the observed variability of SIFyield apparent.}},

abstract = {{Mounting evidence indicates dryland ecosystems play an important role in driving the interannual variability and trend of the terrestrial carbon sink. Nevertheless, our understanding of the seasonal dynamics of dryland ecosystem carbon uptake through photosynthesis [gross primary productivity (GPP)] remains relatively limited due in part to the limited availability of long-term data and unique challenges associated with satellite remote sensing across dryland ecosystems. Here, we comprehensively evaluated longstanding and emerging satellite vegetation proxies in their ability to capture seasonal dryland GPP dynamics. Specifically, we evaluated: 1) reflectance-based proxies normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), soil adjusted vegetation index (SAVI), near infrared reflectance index (NIRv), and kernel NDVI (kNDVI) from the MODerate resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS); and 2) newly available physiologically-based proxy solar-induced chlorophyll fluorescence (SIF) from the TROPOspheric Monitoring Instrument (TROPOMI). As a performance benchmark, we used GPP estimates from a robust network of 21 western United States eddy covariance tower sites that span representative gradients in dryland ecosystem climate and functional composition. We found that NIRv and SIF were the best performing GPP proxies and captured complementary aspects of seasonal GPP dynamics across dryland ecosystem types. NIRv offered better performance than the other proxies across relatively low-productivity, sparsely non-evergreen vegetated sites (R2 = 0.59 ± 0.13); whereas SIF best captured seasonal dynamics across relatively high-productivity sites, including evergreen-dominated sites (R2 = 0.74 ± 0.07). Notably, across grass-dominated sites, all reflectance-based proxies (NDVI, SAVI, NIRv and kNDVI) showed significant seasonal bias (hysteresis) that strengthened with the total fraction of woody vegetation cover, likely due to seasonal patterns in woody vegetation reflectance that are unrelated to or decoupled from GPP. Future efforts to fully integrate the complementary strengths of NIRv and SIF could significantly improve our understanding and representation of dryland GPP dynamics in satellite-based models.}},

However, the influence of environmental conditions on the relationship between GPP and SIF is still unclear. In this study, we synthesized GOME-2 SIF and FLUXCOM GPP coupled with climate data to explore the spatial pattern of the GPP-SIF relationship and its sensitivity to climate conditions at global scale during 2007–2018. The slope (GPP/SIF) of the intercept-free linear regression, which contained information about the allocation of light energy for fluorescence and photosynthesis, was used to represent the GPP-SIF relationship. Our study found that the slope and R2 of the GPP-SIF relationship were spatially heterogeneous, with high slope mainly distributed in the tropical regions and boreal regions and the high R2 mainly concentrated in temperate ecosystems of the Northern Hemisphere. In climate regimes, we found that the GPP-SIF relationship was jointly constrained by environmental variables and the slope had a significant decreasing trend in climate regions from high mean annual temperature (MAT) and low mean annual photosynthetically active radiation (MAR) to low MAT and high MAR. Furthermore, the slope and mean annual precipitation (MAP) have a positive correlation, which indicated the GPP-SIF relationship was climate-dependent. Environmental stress may destroy the relationship between fluorescence and photosynthesis by increasing non-photochemical quenching (NPQ). Our research showed that environmental conditions regulated the light energy distribution for fluorescence and photosynthesis, so accurate estimation of terrestrial ecosystem productivity based on SIF should consider the constraints of climate variables.}},

Many operational BRDF/albedo algorithms adopt a Roujean linear kernel-driven BRDF (RLKB) model because of its simple form and good performance in fitting multidirectional surface reflectance values. However, this model does not explicitly consider topographic effects, resulting in errors when applied over rugged terrain. To address this issue, we proposed a hybrid algorithm suitable for both flat and rugged terrain, called topographical kernel-driven (Topo-KD). First, we constructed a linear kernel-driven BRDF model considering terrain (LKB\_T) which describes the topographic effects with a mountain radiative transfer (MRT) model. Then, the Topo-KD algorithm adaptively selects the most suitable model (RLKB or LKB\_T) according to the terrain conditions and fitting residuals. The performances of Topo-KD and RLKB using the RossThick-LiSparseReciprocal (RTLSR) kernel are compared using simulated data sets and moderate-resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS) observations. The results show that the BRDF of the pixel is affected by topography. But the RTLSR model does not specifically account for it, resulting in larger biases over rugged terrain than the Topo-KD algorithm in both the red and near-infrared (NIR) bands. The experiment using MODIS data sets demonstrates that the Topo-KD algorithm reduces fitting residuals in the red and NIR bands by 21.5\&\#x0025; and 27.4\&\#x0025; compared with the RTLSR model. These results indicate that the Topo-KD algorithm can be a better choice for retrieving land surface parameters and describing the radiative transfer process in mountainous areas.}},

This study developed a spatially contiguous global OCO‐2 SIF product at 0.05° and 16‐day resolutions ( oco2\_005) using machine learning constrained by physiological understandings. This was achieved by stratifying biomes and times for training and predictions, which accounts for varying plant physiological properties in space and time. oco2\_005 accurately preserved the spatiotemporal variations of oco2\_orbit across the globe. Validation of oco2\_005 with Chlorophyll Fluorescence Imaging Spectrometer airborne measurements revealed striking consistency (R2 = 0.72; regression slope = 0.96). Further, without time and biome stratification, (1) oco2\_005 of croplands, deciduous temperate, and needleleaf forests would be underestimated during the peak season, (2) oco2\_005 of needleleaf forests would be overestimated during autumn, and (3) the capability of oco2\_005 to detect drought would be diminished. Newly available observations of solar‐induced chlorophyll fluorescence (SIF) from satellite sensors represent a major step toward quantifying photosynthesis globally in real time. However, existing satellite SIF records are restricted to low spatial resolutions, sparse data acquisition, or both. These limitations impede the full capability of SIF for improving our understanding of dynamics of photosynthesis and its response to environmental changes (particularly in heterogeneous landscapes) to better support carbon source/sink attribution and verification. This study developed a novel high‐resolution time series of spatially contiguous SIF for the globe, leveraging NASA's Orbiting Carbon Observatory‐2 measurements. We combined machine learning algorithms with known physiological constraints for this effort. Comparison with independent airborne SIF measurements revealed strong consistency, confirming the high quality of this new SIF data set. The high‐resolution and global contiguous coverage of this data set will greatly enhance the synergy between satellite SIF and photosynthesis measured on the ground at consistent spatial scales. Potential applications with this data set include advancing dynamic drought monitoring and mitigation, informing agricultural planning and yield estimation in a more spatially explicit way, and providing a benchmark for upcoming satellite missions with SIF capabilities at higher spatial resolutions. A spatially contiguous global OCO‐2 SIF data set at 0.05° and 16‐day resolutions ( oco2\_005) was developed using machine learning and physiological constraints oco2\_005 successfully preserves the spatiotemporal variability of the original OCO‐2 SIF retrievals, captures water stress, and reduces noise oco2\_005 is highly consistent with independent airborne measurements, demonstrating the effectiveness and validity of the prediction framework}},

abstract = {{Solar-induced chlorophyll fluorescence (SIF) has emerged as a leading approach for remote sensing of gross primary productivity (GPP). While SIF has an intrinsic, underlying relationship with canopy light capture and light use efficiency, these physiological relationships are obscured by the fact that satellites observe a small and variable fraction of total emitted canopy SIF. Upon emission, most SIF photons are reabsorbed or scattered within the canopy, preventing their observation remotely. The complexities of the radiative transfer process, which vary across time and space, limit our ability to reliably infer physiological processes from SIF observations. Here, we propose an approach for estimating the fraction of total emitted near-infrared SIF (760 nm) photons that escape the canopy by combining the near-infrared reflectance of vegetation (NIRV) and the fraction of absorbed photosynthetically active radiation (fPAR), two widely available remote sensing products. Our approach relies on the fact that NIRV is resilient against soil background contamination, allowing us to reliably calculate the bidirectional reflectance factor of vegetation, which in turn conveys information about the escape ratio of SIF photons. Our NIRV-based approach explains variations in the escape ratio with an R2 of 0.91 and an RMSE of 1.48\% across a series of simulations where canopy structure, soil brightness, and sun-sensor-canopy geometry are varied. The approach is applicable to conditions of low leaf area index and fractional vegetation cover. We show that correcting for the escape ratio of SIF using NIRV provides robust estimates of total emitted SIF, providing for the possibility of studying physiological variations of fluorescence yield at the global scale.}},

abstract = {{ Solar Induced chlorophyll Fluorescence (SIF) shows promise as an approach for estimating gross primary production (GPP) remotely. However, sun-target-sensor geometry and within-canopy absorption of SIF can alter the relationship between measured SIF and GPP, because sensors can only retrieve some unknown fraction of the total emitted SIF. Radiative transfer models that allow for variation in canopy structure and sensor angles are therefore needed to properly interpret SIF measurements. Spectral invariants allow decoupling of the wavelength-independent canopy structure and the wavelength-dependent leaf and soil spectrum in the radiative transfer process. Here we develop a simple analytical Fluorescence Radiative Transfer model based on Escape and Recollision probability (FluorRTER) to investigate the impact of canopy structure and sun-target-sensor geometry on SIF emissions. SIF simulations using the FluorRTER model agreed well the one-dimensional Soil-Canopy Observation of Photochemistry and Energy balance (SCOPE) model and the three-dimensional Fluorescence model with Weighted Photon Spread (FluorWPS) model. The fractional vegetation cover (FVC) and clumping effect have a large influence the SIF emission of 3D discontinuous canopies. For a moderate solar zenith angle (30°) and a clumped canopy (FVC = 0.6), the difference between the directional observed SIF of a 3D discontinuous canopy and a 1D homogeneous canopy was as large as 43.2\% and 38.4\% for Photosystem I + II fluorescence at 685 nm and at 740 nm, respectively. By bridging the gap between observed SIF and total emitted SIF over 3D heterogeneous vegetation canopies, the FluorRTER model can assist with the angular normalization of SIF measurements and enable the more robust interpretation of how variations in SIF from directional and hemispherical in-situ, airborne and satellite observations relate to leaf and whole-canopy physiological processes.}},

abstract = {{Disentangling the individual contributions from vegetation and soil in measured canopy reflectance is a grand challenge to the remote sensing and ecophysiology communities. Since Solar Induced chlorophyll Fluorescence (SIF) is uniquely emitted from vegetation, it can be used to evaluate how well reflectance-based vegetation indices (VIs) can separate the vegetation and soil components. Due to the residual soil background contributions, Near-infrared (NIR) reflectance of vegetation (NIRv) and Difference Vegetation index (DVI) present offsets when compared to SIF (i.e., the value of NIRv or DVI is non-zero when SIF is zero). In this study, we proposed a simple framework for estimating the true NIR reflectance of vegetation from Hyperspectral measurements (NIRvH) with minimal soil impacts. NIRvH takes advantage of the spectral shape variations in the red-edge region to minimize the soil effects. We evaluated the capability of NIRvH, NIRv and DVI in isolating the true NIR reflectance of vegetation using the data from both the model-based simulations and Hyperspectral Plant imaging spectrometer (HyPlant) measurements. Benchmarked by simultaneously measured SIF, NIRvH has the smallest offset (0–0.037), as compared to an intermediate offset of 0.047–0.062 from NIRv, and the largest offset of 0.089–0.112 from DVI. The magnitude of the offset can vary with different soil reflectance spectra across spatio-temporal scales, which may lead to bias in the downstream NIRv-based photosynthesis estimates. NIRvH and SIF measurements from the same sensor platform avoided complications due to different geometry, footprint and time of observation across sensors when studying the radiative transfer of reflected photons and SIF. In addition, NIRvH was primarily determined by canopy structure rather than chlorophyll content and soil brightness. Our work showcases that NIRvH is promising for retrieving canopy structure parameters such as leaf area index and leaf inclination angle, and for estimating fluorescence yield with current and forthcoming hyperspectral satellite measurements.}},

abstract = {{Phenology plays an important role in affecting carbon sequestration in terrestrial ecosystems in the context of climate change. Remote sensing techniques have been widely used to investigate land surface phenology and the effects of phenology on ecosystem production at regional and global scales. Recently, the near-infrared reflectance of vegetation (NIRv) and solar-induced chlorophyll fluorescence (SIF) have been shown to be more promising metrics of gross primary production (GPP) than the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and the enhanced vegetation index (EVI). However, there is a lack of comparison in the performance of these techniques for deriving phenological metrics. In this study, we explored the consistency in phenological metrics derived from both remote sensing approaches (NDVI, EVI, NIRv, and SIF) and flux tower GPP at six plantations (two broadleaf forests (BF) and four coniferous forests (CF)) in eastern China over the period 2006–2020. The vegetation indices (NDVI, EVI, NIRv) were derived from MODIS data, and SIF was based on the global, OCO-2 based SIF product (GOSIF). We further evaluated the effects of spring and autumn phenology on GPP. The results showed that the flux tower GPP was effectively tracked by NDVI, EVI, NIRv, and SIF (P < 0.001). Meanwhile, the phenological metrics derived from EVI, NIRv, and SIF, including the start of growing season (SOS), the end of growing season (EOS), and the length of growing season (GSL), had significant relationships with those derived from GPP at the six plantations (P < 0.05). NIRv and SIF were more effective at estimating phenological information than NDVI and EVI. In addition, the root mean squared deviation (RMSD) values between the GPP- and NIRv-retrieved phenological dates were less than those derived from NDVI, EVI, and SIF at the BF sites. However, the differences among RMSD values of NDVI, EVI, NIRv, and SIF were not significant at the CF sites. The linear regression analysis showed that the advance of SOSGPP (i.e., SOS derived from GPP) significantly increased GPP (R2=0.29, P < 0.05) over the period from March to April, and the delay of EOSGPP (i.e., EOS derived from GPP) remarkably enhanced GPP (R2=0.61, P < 0.001) over the period from September to October at the BF sites. The relationship of EOSGPP with GPP (R2=0.90, P < 0.05) over the period September-October was strong at the CF sites. In addition, the variations of annual GPP could be captured by GSLGPP × GPPmax, GSLNIRv × NIRvmax, and GSLSIF × SIFmax effectively across the BF and CF sites. These findings can help us understand the potential ability of NIRv and SIF in estimating phenological metrics and in revealing the effects of vegetation phenology on the carbon cycle.}},
